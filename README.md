# softuni-angular-popravka

This project represents my initial effort of creating a photo community.

As part of it you can work with photo entities:

*upload photos, 
*view all uploaded photos and 
*view a page which rankes the photos with most votes.

The other part of the project allows you to work with offer via the so-called bazar.
The bazar allows you to:

*publish offers for buyng and selling photographic equipment
*view all offers already published by the author

Users that are not authenticated are able to view only the top rated photo page and all offers but cannot open the details pages of any of the two entities.
